# What is CyBench Launcher

-----------------------
**NOTE:** CyBench services moved to dedicated host `https://app.cybench.io` from previous `https://www.gocypher.com/`. 
This change is reflected in CyBench client version `1.3.0`. For previous versions, set Java System Property 
`sendReportToURL` when running CyBench Launcher:
```cmd
-DsendReportToURL=https://app.cybench.io/gocypher-benchmarks-reports/services/v1/reports/report
```
-----------------------

**CyBench Launcher** is a standalone Java application designed to
execute [JMH](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/) benchmarks. Speed-test Java classes, collections,
modules, libraries and other application building blocks under varying runtime conditions. Share your results with the
community, compare and choose the right libraries for your application.
**CyBench** helps developers build better, faster Java code by benchmarking code performance.

CyBench Launcher contains a set of default performance tests developed by the CyBench team to benchmark Java Core
services. These tests are executed by default every time CyBench benchmarks are executed via `cybench` shell script and
results are automatically submitted to a public [CyBench Repository](https://app.cybench.io).

Default benchmark execution and automated reporting can be configured
via `<cybench-home>/conf/cybench-launcher.properties`
Download and run CyBench [here](https://github.com/K2NIO/cybench-java-benchmarks/releases). Visit
our [page](https://app.cybench.io)
to analyze your results.

## Running User-defined Benchmarks using CyBench Launcher

#### Add the runner and JMH dependencies to your project

```xml

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.openjdk.jmh</groupId>
        <artifactId>jmh-generator-annprocess</artifactId>
        <version>1.34</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.openjdk.jmh</groupId>
        <artifactId>jmh-core</artifactId>
        <version>1.34</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.gocypher.cybench.client</groupId>
        <artifactId>gocypher-cybench-runner</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

#### Run your benchmarks

- Implement any benchmarks classes
- Add call to the runner main class

```java
    public static void main(String[]args)throws Exception{
        BenchmarkRunner.main(args);
        }
```

- Analyze results in your console, reports folder or [app.cybench.io](https://app.cybench.io/cybench/)
- **Optional:** Add CyBench configuration file into `<project-path>/conf/cybench-launcher.properties` directory to
  manage your benchmarking run
  configuration. [Configuration example](https://github.com/K2NIO/gocypher-cybench-java/blob/master/gocypher-cybench-client/gocypher-cybench-runner/src/main/resources/cybench-launcher.properties)

#### CyBench launcher configuration

| Property name | Description | Default value |
| ------------- |-------------| -----:|
| **javaOptions** | All the property fields that starts with name javaOptions will be used while benchmarking as JVM properties. | - |
| **javaToUsePath** | Provide full path to java.exe to be used e.g. `D:/jdk180_162/bin/java.exe` | - |
| **benchmarks** | Provide jar's with JMH benchmarks which shall be executed with CyBench. [more here](#adding-custom-benchmarks-for-execution)| - |
| **sendReport** | Choose if the report generated will be automatically uploaded. (true/false) | true |
| **reportUploadStatus** | Define public or private property for the uploaded report visibility. | public |
| **benchAccessToken** | By providing the "bench" token that you get after creating a workspace in CyBench UI, you can send reports to your private directory, which will be visible only to the users that you authorize. | - |
| **emailAddress** | Email property is used to identify report sender while sending reports to both private and public repositories | - |
| **reportName** | Choose the uploaded report name. E.g. | - |
| **benchmarkClasses** | Specify benchmarks by including fully qualified benchmark class names which are comma separated. For more information [more here](#execute-only-custom-benchmarks)| - |
| **numberOfBenchmarkForks** | Number of separate full executions of a benchmark (warm up+measurement), this is returned still as one primary score item. | 1 |
| **measurementIterations** | Number of measurements per benchmark operation, this is returned still as one primary score item. | 5 |
| **warmUpIterations** | Number of iterations executed for warm up. | 1 |
| **warmUpSeconds** | Number of seconds dedicated for each warm up iteration. | 5 |
| **runThreadCount** | Number of threads for benchmark test execution. | 1 |
| **benchmarkModes** | Benchmark modes to run. | `All`, or ones defined by annotation |
| **jmhArguments** | JMH CLI supported arguments line. See [JMH Command line options](https://github.com/guozheng/jmh-tutorial/blob/master/README.md#jmh-command-line-options) for details| - |
| **benchmarkMetadata** | A property which adds extra properties to the benchmarks report such as category or version or context. Configuration pattern is `<fully qualified benchmark class name>=<key1>:<value1>;<key2>:<value2>`. Example which adds category for class CollectionsBenchmarks: `com.gocypher.benchmarks.client.CollectionsBenchmarks=category:Collections;`   | - |
| **userProperties** | User defined properties which will be added to benchmarks report section `environmentSettings->userDefinedProperties` as key/value strings. Configuration pattern:`<key1>:<value1>;<key2>:<value2>`. Example which adds a project name:`user.propname1=My Test Project;` | - |

### Adding Custom Benchmarks for Execution

Update CyBench Launcher configuration located in `<cybench-home>/conf/cybench-launcher.properties`:

* __required__: add or update property `benchmarks`, set path to jar file which contains your JMH benchmark, this path
  will be added to the
  `CLASSPATH` of the JVM. Values must be semicolon separated!

  Rule:
    ```properties
    benchmarks=<path to custom jar file1>;<path to custom jar file2>;
    ```

  Example:
    ```properties
    benchmarks=gocypher-cybench-custom-1.0.0.jar;
    ```

* __optional__: register categories for your tests in order to have correct tests classification and better readability
  and comparison in CyBench portal. If not set then default value (`Custom`) will be written and all custom tests will
  reside under this category. Values of different classes must be semicolon separated!

  Rule:
    ```properties
    benchmarkMetadata=<fully classified benchmark class name>=category:<category name>;\
      <fully classified benchmark class name>=category:<category name>;
    ```

  Example:
    ```properties
    benchmarkMetadata=com.gocypher.benchmarks.client.CollectionsBenchmarks=category:Collections;
    ```

### Execute Only Custom Benchmarks

Update CyBench configuration in order to run only user-defined tests:

* add or update property `benchmarkClasses`, specify class names of tests which shall be executed (values must be comma
  separated).

  Rule:
    ```properties
    benchmarkClasses=<fully qualified class name, or class name>,<fully qualified class name, or class name>
    ```
  Example:
    ```properties
    benchmarkClasses=com.gocypher.benchmarks.client.CollectionsBenchmarks,NumberBenchmarks
    ```

### Benchmark reports comparator

Java app comparing most recently ran CyBench benchmarks to previously ran benchmarks hosted on the CyBench site.
